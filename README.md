## Where Are These Images From?

Wallpapes are found in different locations but good places to check out are [Imgur](http://imgur.com) and [/wg/](http://4chan.org/wg).  Some of the wallpapers were probably included in default wallpaper packages from various Linux distributions that I have installed over the years.

## Ownership

Because most images are downloaded from sites like Imgur and /wg/, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these images. If you find an image hosted in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and I will remove it.
